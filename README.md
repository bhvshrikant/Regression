1. Jamboree Case Study

## **Jamboree Case Study**

### Overview
The case study aims to analyse the predictor variables to draw insights about the importance of various factors in prediction of chances of graduate admission and how they are related to each other.
1. Identified and handled the outlier.
2. Implemented Linear, Lasso and Ridge Regression models and identified which model works best in this case.
3. Identifies the factors that are most and least significant in the assessment of the target feature.

### Key Questions
1. What are the most significant factors affecting the chances of admission?
2. How are these factors correlated among themselves?
3. What do an aspirant do to get a 95% chance of admission?
4. Ridge(L2) vs Lasso(L1). Which one worked better?
